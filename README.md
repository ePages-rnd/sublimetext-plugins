Installation
------------
The plugins are available through [Sublime Package Contol](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). If you have not done this yet, follow [these instructions](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation) to install Package Control.


### Prepare Sublime Text 3

This repo provides a repository.json, which points to the latest releases. Open the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows) and choose `Package Control: Add repository`. Enter following url:

```
https://raw.github.com/ePages-rnd/sublimetext-plugins/master/repository.json
```

### Install

Now you can install the plugins:

* Bring up the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows). 
* Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list. 
* Search for our plugins.

The advantage of using this method is that Package Control will automatically keep the plugins up to date with the latest version.
