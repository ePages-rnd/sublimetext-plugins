Installation
------------
Currently the plugins are **not** available through [Sublime Package Contol](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). 
So you have to manually copy the desired plugins (i.e. folders in this repository) to your Packages directory. In Sublime Text:

* Click the **Preferences > Browse Packagesâ€¦** menu entry.
* Browse up a folder. You should see a **Packages** directory.
* Download the desired folder from this repo and copy it into the **Packages** directory
* Restart Sublime Text

Configuration
--------------
See the **README.md** inside the plugin folders for personal settings you may have to adjust.

Plugins
--------

* Restart perl.
* Set JSDebugLevel.
* Import and delete XMLs.

Development
----------
* Try to **avoid duplication** of functionality in different plugins.
* The aim should be to have **all plugins** in this repo working next to each other.
* Document functionality in a **README.md** in your plugin folder.
* Resources for development:
